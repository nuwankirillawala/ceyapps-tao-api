# Testing Lesson Creation - Fixed Version

## Problem Resolved âœ…
The issue with empty strings causing Cloudflare service errors has been fixed. The service now properly filters out empty values before processing.

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Create Lesson with Only Required Fields âœ…
```bash
POST /courses/{courseId}/lessons
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Introduction to Bartending",
  "content": "Basic instructions for beginners"
}
```
**Expected Result**: Lesson created successfully without errors

### Test 2: Create Lesson with Empty videoId (Should Work) âœ…
```bash
POST /courses/{courseId}/lessons
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Introduction to Bartending",
  "content": "Basic instructions for beginners",
  "videoId": ""
}
```
**Expected Result**: Lesson created successfully, videoId ignored

### Test 3: Create Lesson with Empty materialIds (Should Work) âœ…
```bash
POST /courses/{courseId}/lessons
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Introduction to Bartending",
  "content": "Basic instructions for beginners",
  "materialIds": ["", ""]
}
```
**Expected Result**: Lesson created successfully, empty materialIds ignored

### Test 4: Create Lesson with Valid videoId âœ…
```bash
POST /courses/{courseId}/lessons
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Introduction to Bartending",
  "content": "Basic instructions for beginners",
  "videoId": "actual-video-uuid-here"
}
```
**Expected Result**: Lesson created with video details from Cloudflare

### Test 5: Create Lesson with Valid materialIds âœ…
```bash
POST /courses/{courseId}/lessons
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Introduction to Bartending",
  "content": "Basic instructions for beginners",
  "materialIds": ["actual-material-uuid-1", "actual-material-uuid-2"]
}
```
**Expected Result**: Lesson created with materials from Cloudflare

## What Was Fixed

1. **Empty String Filtering**: Added validation to filter out empty strings for `videoId` and `materialIds`
2. **Graceful Handling**: Empty values are now ignored instead of causing errors
3. **Better Validation**: Added `@IsNotEmpty()` decorator to required fields
4. **Improved Documentation**: Updated API descriptions to clarify optional fields

## Current Behavior

- **Empty strings** are automatically filtered out
- **Undefined/null values** are handled gracefully
- **Valid IDs** are processed normally with Cloudflare integration
- **Required fields** (title) are properly validated

## Test the Fix

Try creating a lesson again with the same payload:

```json
{
  "title": "Introduction to Bartending",
  "content": "Basic instructions for beginners",
  "videoId": "",
  "materialIds": ["", ""]
}
```

This should now work without errors! ðŸŽ‰
