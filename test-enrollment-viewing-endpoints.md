# Enrollment Viewing Endpoints Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide covers testing all the new enrollment viewing endpoints that provide comprehensive access to enrollment data with proper role-based permissions.

## üîÑ New Enrollment Viewing Endpoints

### 1. **Get All Enrollments** - `GET /enrollment`
- **Purpose**: Retrieve all course enrollments with pagination and filtering
- **Authentication**: JWT required
- **Role Requirements**: ADMIN or INSTRUCTOR only
- **Features**: Pagination, filtering by status, courseId, userId

### 2. **Get User Enrollments** - `GET /enrollment/user/:userId`
- **Purpose**: Get enrollments for a specific user

- **Features**: Pagination, filtering by status

### 3. **Get Course Enrollments** - `GET /enrollment/course/:courseId`
- **Purpose**: Get all enrollments for a specific course
- **Authentication**: JWT required
- **Role Requirements**: ADMIN/INSTRUCTOR or users enrolled in the course

## üöÄ Testing Commands

### **Start the Application**
```bash
yarn start:dev
```

### **Test with cURL**

#### **Get All Enrollments (Admin)**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/enrollment?page=1&limit=10&status=ACTIVE" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin-jwt-token}"
```

#### **Get User Enrollments**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/enrollment/user/{userId}?page=1&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}"
```

#### **Get Course Enrollments**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/enrollment/course/{courseId}?page=1&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}"
```

#### **Get My Enrollments**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/enrollment/my-enrollments?status=ACTIVE" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}"
```

#### **Get Specific Enrollment**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/enrollment/{enrollmentId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}"
```

### **Test with Swagger**
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/api`
2. Navigate to enrollment endpoints
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Add your JWT token
5. Test different parameters and permissions

## üîç Debugging Tips

### **Check JWT Token**
```bash
# Decode JWT to see user info and role
echo "your.jwt.token" | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d | jq
```

### **Check Database**
```sql
-- Check enrollments
SELECT * FROM "UserEnrollment" LIMIT 5;

-- Check specific user enrollments
SELECT * FROM "UserEnrollment" WHERE "userId" = 'user-uuid-123';

-- Check course enrollments
SELECT * FROM "UserEnrollment" WHERE "courseId" = 'course-uuid-123';
```

### **Check Logs**
```bash
# Monitor application logs
tail -f logs/app.log
```

## üìù Expected Database Queries

The endpoints will generate these types of Prisma queries:

```typescript
// Get all enrollments with filters
prisma.userEnrollment.findMany({
  where: { status: 'ACTIVE', courseId: 'course-uuid' },
  include: { user: true, course: true },
  orderBy: { enrolledAt: 'desc' },
  skip: 0,
  take: 10
})

// Get user enrollments
prisma.userEnrollment.findMany({
  where: { userId: 'user-uuid', status: 'ACTIVE' },
  include: { course: true },
  orderBy: { enrolledAt: 'desc' }
})
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: 403 Forbidden on Course Enrollments**
**Cause**: User not enrolled in course
**Solution**: Check if user is enrolled or has ADMIN/INSTRUCTOR role

### **Issue 2: Empty Results**
**Cause**: No enrollments match filters
**Solution**: Check database for enrollment data

### **Issue 3: Pagination Not Working**
**Cause**: Invalid page/limit parameters
**Solution**: Ensure page ‚â• 1, limit ‚â§ 100

### **Issue 4: Missing User/Course Details**
**Cause**: Database relationship issues
**Solution**: Check Prisma schema and relationships

**Note**: These endpoints provide comprehensive enrollment viewing capabilities with proper role-based access control. Test thoroughly to ensure data security and proper permissions.
