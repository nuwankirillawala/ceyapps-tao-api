# Payment API Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive payment system implemented in the ceyapps-tao-api, following the same structure as the opushub-api payment implementation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The payment system is organized into four main modules:

1. **Payment User** (`/payment-users`) - Manages Stripe customer information
2. **Cards** (`/cards`) - Handles payment methods and cards
3. **Subscription** (`/subscriptions`) - Manages user subscriptions
4. **Subscription Plans** (`/subscription-plans`) - Administers subscription plans and coupons

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

All endpoints require JWT authentication (`JwtAuthGuard`). Admin-only endpoints are protected with `RolesGuard` and require the `ADMIN` role.
